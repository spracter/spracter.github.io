            <br />
            <b>INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USE.</b>
            <br />
            We do not collect any information about you in any form. This is
            our number one feature and priority, and we have a very strict
            zero-knowledge policy which is enforced throughout various parts
            of our product and service.
            <br />
            <br />
            <b>DATA STORAGE & DELETION.</b>
            <br />
            Your data is stored securely on your device. A copy of your
            notes and data is also stored on your Google Drive in a secure
            manner for sync functionality and backups. Reynote makes use of
            a built-in feature of Google Drive known as 'appDataFolder',
            which is used to store all data securely. This folder or its
            contents are not visible to anyone except the app itself.
            However, a Google Drive user (you) have the option to delete
            this folder from their Drive. In case this folder is deleted or
            altered in any way, due to any reason whatsoever, the data in
            this folder may be corrupted or lost permanently. In such a
            scenario, this data might not be recoverable and may be lost
            completely and permanently. We cannot be held responsible for
            this, although we will try our best to help you in whatever ways
            we can. You are totally in control and your data is your own
            responsibility. It should be noted that "Clear Storage" and/or
            "Clear Cache" options which are accessible through Android's app
            information & settings window will result in complete data wipe
            and permanent deletion of your data, in which case we will not
            be responsible for the same.
            <br />
            <br />
            <b>LINKS.</b>
            <br />
            Your notes stored in Reynote and any associated services may
            contain links to other sites. Spracter is not responsible for
            the privacy policy or other practices employed by web sites
            linked to, or from, our app nor the information or content
            contained therein.
            <br />
            <br />
            <b>DATA SECURITY.</b>
            <br />
            We are committed to ensuring that your information is secure. In
            order to prevent unauthorized access or disclosure, we have put
            in place suitable physical, electronic and managerial procedures
            to safeguard and secure your notes and data. We will not sell,
            distribute or lease your any of your data or personal
            information to third parties unless we have your permission or
            are required by law to do so.
            <br />
            <br />
            <b>APP ORIGIN.</b>
            <br />
            By using Reynote, you accept that the app copy downloaded and
            installed on your device was obtained from the original Google
            Play Store or other original authorised vendor / channel only.
            We cannot be held responsible for any data leak, privacy breach
            or misuse of your personal or sensitive information that arises
            from you using a pirated version / copy of Reynote or a version
            / copy of the app obtained from untrusted or illicit sources.

            <br />
            <b>PASSWORDS.</b>
            <br />
            We do not store your passwords any where, in any form, except on
            your device. There is no way for us to know what your passwords
            are and therefore, it is completely your responsibility to
            remember and keep your passwords safe. In case you forget your
            password, whether of a note or of the app itself, you may use
            one of your recovery keys which you can only obtain by
            contacting us directly from the registered email. For more
            information about this, refer to the FAQs section in Settings.
            Any data loss that occurs under such a circumstance will not be
            our responsibility.

            <br />
            <b>CONTENT RIGHTS.</b>
            <br />
            While you own the Content you store within the Reynote service
            (subject to third party rights), you acknowledge and agree that
            Spracter (and our licensors) own(s) all legal right, title and
            interest in and to the Service, including, without limitation,
            all apps that is part of the Service and all Spracter apps

            originating outside the Service.
            <br />
            <br />
            <b>INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS.</b>
            <br />
            In agreeing to these Terms, you also agree that the rights in
            the Service and Spracter apps, including all intellectual
            property rights, such as trademarks, patents, designs and
            copyrights, are protected by one or more of copyright,
            trademark, patent, trade secret and other laws, regulations and
            treaties, in addition to these Terms and any Separate Agreement.
            In particular, you agree to not modify, create derivative works
            of, decompile or otherwise attempt to extract source code from
            any Spracter apps, unless you are expressly permitted to do so
            under an open source license, we give you express written
            permission or you are otherwise legally permitted to do so
            notwithstanding this prohibition.
            <br />
            <br />
            <b>RIGHT TO MODIFY THE SERVICE.</b>
            <br />
            We retain the right, in our sole discretion, to implement new
            elements as part of and/or ancillary to the Service, including
            changes that may affect the previous mode of operation of the
            Service or Spracter apps. We expect that any such modifications
            will enhance the overall Service, but it is possible that you
            may not agree with us. We also reserve the right to establish
            limits to the nature or size of storage available to you, the
            number of transmissions, the ability to send or receive email
            messages, the nature or size of any index or library
            information, the nature of, or your continued ability to access
            or distribute, your Content and other data, and impose other
            limitations at any time, with or without notice. For example, if
            you use Reynote Basic, you will not enjoy all of the benefits
            provided to users of Reynote Plus or Reynote Premium.
            <br />
            <br />
            You also acknowledge that a variety of Spracter actions may
            impair or prevent you from accessing your Content or using the
            Service at certain times and/or in the same way, for limited
            periods or permanently, and agree that Spracter has no
            responsibility or liability as a result of any such actions or
            results, including, without limitation, for the deletion of, or
            failure to make available to you, any Content. You agree that we
            shall not be liable to you or to any third party for any
            modification, suspension or discontinuance of any part of the
            Service. However, if you are a user of Reynote Plus, Reynote
            Premium or another paid version of the Service (each a “Paid
            Service”) and find that any such modifications or interruption
            of the Paid Service adversely affects you, you may notify our
            Customer Support team, explain the adverse impact the
            modification has created and, if you desire, request a
            termination of your Paid Service. Upon receipt of any such
            request, we will endeavor to promptly remedy the adverse impact
            caused by the modification, extend the duration of your Paid
            Service plan for a period of time equal to the interruption
            and/or refund a portion of your Paid Service plan fee equal to
            the remaining unused term of the Paid Service plan, as we
            determine appropriate or as may be required by applicable law.
            <br />
            <br />
            <b>RIGHT TO ENGAGE THIRD PARTIES.</b>
            <br />
            Spracter engages certain affiliates or other third parties
            (“Service Providers”) to provide technical or other services
            relating to all or part of the Service, and you hereby agree
            that such involvement by these Service Providers is acceptable.
            In addition, Spracter may contract with third party resellers of
            the Reynote Plus or Premium versions of the Service and payment
            processors to enable payments in your local currency and payment
            systems. Please see our Privacy Policy to understand the extent
            to which any affiliate or third party may have access to your
            account information or Content and our Commercial Terms to
            understand our relationship with any reseller or payment
            processor.
            <br />
            <br />
            <b>RIGHT TO USE THIRD-PARTY APPS.</b>
            <br />
            Spracter may from time to time include as part of the Service
            and Spracter apps, computer apps supplied by third parties which
            is utilized by permission of the respective licensors and/or
            copyright holders on the terms provided by such parties. We
            provide information about some of this third party apps here and
            within the particular Spracter apps. Spracter expressly
            disclaims any warranty or other assurance to you regarding such
            third party apps.
            <br />
            <br />
            <b>RIGHT TO UPDATE OUR APPS.</b>
            <br />
            In connection with any modification of the Service, Spracter may
            automatically download app updates on all your devices from time
            to time with the intention of improving, enhancing, repairing
            and/or further developing the Service. Spracter will endeavor to
            provide you with the option of whether or not to install the
            update; however, in certain circumstances (e.g., security
            risks), Spracter may require you to install the update to
            continue accessing the Service. In all cases, you agree to
            permit Spracter to deliver these updates to you (and you to
            receive them) as part of your use of the Service.
            <br />
            <br />
            <b>PAYMENT OF FEES; TAXES.</b>
            <br />
            When you elect to purchase a Paid Service from us and enter a
            form of payment, you agree that: (i) you will fulfill your
            obligation to pay for the Paid Service by the date on which
            payment is due; (ii) any payment information you provide is true
            and accurate; (iii) you are authorized to use the payment method
            you provide; and (iv) we are authorized to charge you for the
            Paid Service using the established payment method and the
            information you provide that is stored in your account as of the
            applicable date for payment. Your assurances of payment and our
            rights to collect payment include any obligation you may have to
            pay any taxes or delivery charges described as being applicable
            to the Product you are buying. In addition, you agree that you
            will be responsible for any credit card chargeback fees as well
            as any reasonable collection costs we incur as a result of your
            failure to pay on a timely basis. You also agree to the fact
            that prices may vary by location and change according to foreign
            exchange rates.
            <br />
            <br />
            You agree to pay the charges for the Paid Service in the
            currency specified by Spracter when you enter into the
            Commercial Transaction, and you assume all risks associated with
            any changing value in the currency compared with other
            currencies. The specified charge for a Paid Service are
            VAT-inclusive and may include certain other taxes or delivery or
            similar charges applicable to your purchase. If any tax or
            charge applicable to a purchase is not charged by us, you
            acknowledge that you are solely responsible for paying the tax
            or other such charge. The receipt provided to you reflecting
            your purchase includes VAT (if applicable) which is charged
            based on your location.
            <br />
            <br />
            Our prices for a Paid Service do not include any of the
            third-party fees you incur in connection with using a Paid
            Service including, without limitation, fees charged by your
            Internet access provider, any wireless carrier charges for
            cellular or data services and any other third party applications
            or services with which you may use the Paid Service; you are
            responsible for selecting and managing these other services, and
            paying the fees for such services.
            <br />
            <br />
            <b>CHANGES IN FEES.</b>
            <br />
            We may change the price of any Paid Service from time to time,
            and add new fees and charges for certain features or to reflect
            a change in business or legal rules, but we will provide you
            with advance notice of changes in fees. Any increase in charges
            for the same Paid Service would not apply until the expiration
            of your then current billing cycle, unless otherwise
            specifically provided in our notice to you, and would become
            effective no sooner than the next time you would be charged for
            that Paid Service. If you do not agree to pay the new price or
            other applicable charges, you may elect not to renew the Paid
            Service plan before the price change goes into effect, which
            cancellation would be effective at the expiration of your then
            current billing cycle.
            <br />
            <br />
            <b>TIME DURATIONS.</b>
            <br />
            Spracter defines 1 month as equal to 30 days or 720 hours. 3
            months is defined as 90 days or 2160 hours. 6 months is defined
            as 180 days or 4320 hours. 9 months is defined as 270 days or
            6480 hours. 12 months is defined as 360 days or 8640 hours.
            <br />
            <br />
            <b>CANCELLATION OF A PAID SERVICE PLANS.</b>
            <br />
            Any paid service plan, once purchased or renewed and after the
            elapse of 48 hours refund period, cannot be cancelled or
            refunded.
            <br />
            <br />
            If you wish to upgrade your existing Paid Service plan to a more
            expensive level of Paid Service, and if you purchased your
            current Paid Service directly from Reynote, your new plan
            renewal will take effect only after the previous pre-paid plan
            time period has elapsed. Example: If you renewed Plus plan for 1
            month on July 1 and then also purchased Premium, 1 month
            duration plan on the same day i.e: July 1, the Premium plan will
            only come into effect after 30 days starting from July 1, once
            the duration for the previous Plus plan has elapsed. Any unused
            portion of a free trial period will be forfeited when the user
            purchases/renews a paid plan. You will not be able to cancel the
            renewal once activated. You can check your transactions and
            renewal history in "Transactions & Summary" in Settings after
            purchase.
            <br />
            <br />
            <b>CREDIT CARD CHARGEBACKS.</b>
            <br />
            If you purchase a Paid Service plan with a credit card and then
            subsequently request your credit card issuer to reverse that
            payment, Spracter is charged a fee that may be a significant
            multiple of the amount we initially received. Accordingly, in
            order to enable you to pay relatively minor fees with a credit
            card, you acknowledge and agree that we reserve the right to
            suspend your ability to add additional Content to your Reynote
            service account until such time as you reimburse us the amount
            of the fee we were charged by the card issuer.
            <br />
            <br />
            <b>REYNOTE PLUS OR PREMIUM.</b>
            <br />
            Except as described below, Reynote Plus and Premium plans
            ("Individual Paid Service" plans) are non-refundable, and no
            prorated refunds or credits will be offered for partially used
            plans. However, if we issue a refund or credit in one instance,
            we are under no obligation to issue the same refund or credit in
            the future.
            <br />
            <br />
            <b>THIRD-PARTY LINKS, CONTENT AND PROGRAMMING.</b>
            <br />
            We may include or recommend third party resources, materials and
            developers and/or links to third party websites, content and
