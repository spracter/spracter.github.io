            responsibility. It should be noted that "Clear Storage" and/or
            "Clear Cache" options which are accessible through Android's app
            information & settings window will result in complete data wipe
            and may result in permanent deletion of your data, in which case we cannot be held responsible, although we will try our best to help you in whatever ways
            we can.
            <br />
            <br />

            <br />
            <br />
            <b>USER OBLIGATIONS.</b>
            <ol>
                <li>When using the Games, the user may not use any other software or other routines that could interfere with the systems of Spracter (and Spracter GameDivision) or other users. This includes actions that could lead to an unreasonable overloading of the systems of Spracter (and Spracter GameDivision). The use of special software, particularly for systematic or automatic control of Games, is prohibited.</li>
                <li>The user may not use any software or exploit any programming errors that lead or could lead to obtaining premium content in the Games or other unintended benefits for the user without having concluded a premium agreement, the user thus becoming obliged to pay the fee for such premium content. In the event of unjustified acquisition of premium content, Spracter (and Spracter GameDivision) may delete or deactivate the unjustified premium content or other benefits. For the purposes of clarification: The above shall not apply if premium content can be acquired as a reward for certain Game actions.</li>
                <li>In connection with the services of Spracter (and Spracter GameDivision), the user may not use any software that enables “data mining” or otherwise collects information in connection with the Games.</li>
                <li>The user may not use, buy for real money (except through the App Stores), sell, trade, or attempt to use Premium Content outside the Game.</li>
                <li>When using any communication functions within the Games, the user must comply with all applicable laws and must not infringe the rights of third parties. In addition, certain content is undesirable in the Games because it contradicts the character of the Games as family entertainment media. In concrete terms, this means that users may not: use, post or publish any harassing, threatening, disturbing, insulting or defamatory, discriminatory, political, immoral, pornographic, morally reprehensible, offensive, violent, sexist, extreme right-wing or left-wing content or content that glorifies violence or violates laws, particularly laws for the protection of minors, or link to corresponding material on a third party website or advertise, offer or distribute such content or products that violates laws, particularly laws for the protection of minors; and publish, duplicate, make publicly accessible or disseminate content protected for the benefit of third parties without a corresponding license, in particular infringe upon industrial property rights, advertise, offer or distribute goods or services, commit or promote anti-competitive acts, request other users to provide personal data for commercial or illegal purposes or to provide access data, organize or advertise commercial activities and sales of third parties, duplicate an image of another person or make it publicly accessible without the written consent of the person concerned, or publish personal data and confidential data without being entitled to do so. Spracter (and Spracter GameDivision) shall be entitled to delete content that violates applicable law and/or these General Terms and Conditions.</li>
                <li>The user may only use the Games for private purposes, unless Spracter (and Spracter GameDivision) has given its express prior written consent to any other use in individual cases.</li>
                <li>Any breach of these General Terms and Conditions may lead to termination for good cause. In lieu of such termination, Spracter (and Spracter GameDivision) may, at its sole discretion, announce measures or take sanctioning measures of any kind to enforce the provisions of these General Terms and Conditions. In particular, this shall include declaring a temporary or permanent virtual ban from the systems, warning the user of their temporary or permanent exclusion of the user from individual Game functions.</li>
                <li>Users shall be obligated to regularly back up all their data on the devices on which they use the Games in a manner appropriate to the risk.</li>
            </ol>
            <br />
            <br />
            <b>CONCLUSION OF CONTRACT, TERM, TERMINATION.</b>
            <ol>
                <li>The user confirms to have full legal capacity and, in the case of restricted legal capacity, to have obtained the consent of his/her legal guardian.</li>
                <li>The contract for the use of the Game is concluded by downloading the Game from the Google Play Store. The download creates a contract between the user and Spracter (and Spracter GameDivision, a subsidiary of Spracter) for the free use of Memiq. The corresponding license and usage agreement on the basis of these General Terms and Conditions is concluded for an indefinite period of time and may be terminated by either party at any time, subject to point 3, without specifying any reasons by providing notice of four weeks.</li>
                <li>In addition to the possibility of free use, Spracter (and Spracter GameDivision) also offers additional paid content, e.g. virtual items and power-ups (premium content). The use of the premium content is voluntary and forgoing such use does not restrict other use of the Game. The cost obligation will be indicated separately in the Game. For the acquisition and use of such premium content, the provisions of these General Terms and Conditions as well as any separate terms and conditions of use of the Google Play Store shall apply in a supplementary fashion. If premium content has a defined duration (e.g. activation of certain premium functions for one month), ordinary termination (also of the contract for free use) shall be excluded during this period. To clarify, ordinary termination shall be possible if the user has purchased premium content without a fixed term (e.g. one-time or permanent power-ups), even if these have effects on the entire further period of use.</li>
                <li>It is recommended to always install the latest version of the Game. Spracter (and Spracter GameDivision) is only obligated to provide the full scope of performance and the correct functionality, even of premium content, for the current version of the Game.</li>
                <li>In the event of ordinary termination by the user or termination by Spracter (and Spracter GameDivision) for good cause, no reimbursement of paid fees shall take place. Spracter (and Spracter GameDivision) shall be entitled to continue to charge all outstanding fees for premium content already purchased.</li>
                <li>The user may not transfer this agreement to third parties. In the event of a breach of this provision (account transfer), Spracter (and Spracter GameDivision) shall be entitled to terminate the agreement without notice, including agreements on premium content. In such event, a prorated refund shall also be excluded.</li>
                <li>The statutory right to extraordinary termination of this Agreement without notice for good cause shall not be affected.</li>
            </ol>
            <br />
            <br />
            <b>PREMIUM CONTENT.</b>
            <ol>
                <li>The contract for additional premium content shall only be concluded if the user clicks on the “Pay” or “Order for a fee” button in the shop area of the Game (exact labelling may vary for in-app purchases). The contract shall be accepted by Spracter (and Spracter GameDivision) (or on its behalf by the respective Google Play Store) by sending an order confirmation via message or email, or by actually providing the respective premium content. The fee shall be payable in advance upon acquisition of premium content.</li>
                <li>A refund after the purchase of premium content can only be made within the scope of statutory consumer rights or the statutory right of revocation with due regard to the respective elements of exclusion.</li>
                <li>The prices for premium content as displayed via Google Play Store and transmitted in the order confirmation for the respective order shall apply in each case. These can vary according to currency and country. The prices include any applicable value added tax. Payments will be processed via Google Play Store. The terms of use and payment of Google Play Store shall apply in this regard, supplemented by these General Terms and Conditions. In the event of contradictions between the general terms and conditions of Google Play Store and these General Terms and Conditions, the terms of use and payment of the Google Play Store shall take precedence.</li>
                <li>If currencies are simulated in the Games (hereinafter, “Coins”), these represent premium content or units of measurement for the scope of the license to use the Game in question, and not real money. If such Coins can be earned both through Game play and as premium content, the units purchased in return for payment will always be used first when such Coins are used. Coins may only be converted back into real money if the operation of the Game as a whole is permanently discontinued. In such an event, the fee paid for Coins shall be refunded insofar as the corresponding Coins have not yet been used to activate Game content.</li>
                <li>The user shall be responsible for cancellations or chargebacks which the user itself has caused, e.g. due to insufficient account coverage. The user shall normally bear the costs arising therefrom. Spracter (and Spracter GameDivision) shall be entitled to collect these costs together with the original fee from the user’s means of payment. The user shall reserve the right to prove that any damage did not occur or did not occur to the value of the requested amount.</li>
                <li>If the user defaults on payment, Spracter (and Spracter GameDivision) may, irrespective of the continued obligation to pay, block access to the Game and demand the default interest stipulated by law.</li>
                <li>Spracter (and Spracter GameDivision) may offer new premium content, change existing premium content and discontinue premium content. Permanent premium content already purchased (virtual items), which are removed from the Game, may in this case be used within a transitional period or exchanged for new premium content. Further claims of the user shall be excluded.</li>
                <li>For purposes of clarification: All claims of the user with respect to the premium content, particularly with respect to copyrights, warranty for defects and damage compensation, shall be asserted against Spracter (and Spracter GameDivision) (and not against the Google Play Store).</li>
            </ol>
            <br />

            notwithstanding this prohibition.
            <br />

            <b>RIGHT TO MODIFY THE GAME/APP.</b>
            <br />
            We retain the right, in our sole discretion, to implement new
            elements as part of and/or ancillary to the game/app, including
            changes that may affect the previous mode of operation of the
            game/app or Spracter (and Spracter GameDivision) apps. We expect that any such modifications
            will enhance the overall game/app, but it is possible that you
            may not agree with us. We also reserve the right to establish
            limits to the nature or size of storage available to you, the
            number of transmissions, the ability to send or receive email
            messages, the nature or size of any index or library
            information, the nature of, or your continued ability to access
            or distribute, your content and other data, and impose other
            limitations at any time, with or without notice.
            <br />
            <br />
            You also acknowledge that a variety of Spracter (and Spracter GameDivision) actions may
            impair or prevent you from accessing your Content or using the
            game/app at certain times and/or in the same way, for limited
            periods or permanently, and agree that Spracter (and Spracter GameDivision) has no
            responsibility or liability as a result of any such actions or
            results, including, without limitation, for the deletion of, or
            failure to make available to you, any Content. You agree that we
            shall not be liable to you or to any third party for any
            modification, suspension or discontinuance of any part of the
            game/app. However, if you find that any such modifications or interruption
            of the paid content adversely affects you, you may notify our
            Customer Support team, explain the adverse impact the
            modification has created and, if you desire, request a
            termination of your paid content. Upon receipt of any such
            request, we will endeavor to promptly remedy the adverse impact
            caused by the modification, provide some in-game form of compensation of your paid
            game/app content for a period of time equal to the interruption
            and/or refund a portion of your paid content fee equal to
            the remaining unused term of the paid content, as we
            determine appropriate or as may be required by applicable law.
            <br />
            <br />
            <b>RIGHT TO UPDATE OUR APPS.</b>
            <br />
            In connection with any modification of the game/app, Spracter (and Spracter GameDivision) may
            automatically download app updates on all your devices from time
            to time with the intention of improving, enhancing, repairing
            and/or further developing the game/app. Spracter (and Spracter GameDivision) will endeavor to
            provide you with the option of whether or not to install the
            update; however, in certain circumstances (e.g., security
            risks), Spracter (and Spracter GameDivision) may require you to install the update to
            continue accessing the game/app. In all cases, you agree to
            permit Spracter (and Spracter GameDivision) to deliver these updates to you (and you to
            receive them) as part of your use of the game/app.

            and add new fees and charges for certain features or to reflect
            a change in business or legal rules, without any prior notice.
            <br />
            <br />
            <b>REFUNDS.</b>
            <br />
            Any paid content that is non-consumable (like "skins", "themes", "frames", etc.), once purchased and after the
            elapse of 48 hours refund period, cannot be cancelled or
            refunded. Any paid content that is consumable (like "coins", "lives", etc.), once purchased cannot be cancelled or
            refunded under any circumstances.
            <br />
            <br />
            <b>CREDIT CARD CHARGEBACKS.</b>
            <br />
            If you purchase any paid content with a credit card and then
            subsequently request your credit card issuer to reverse that
            payment, Spracter (and Spracter GameDivision) is charged a fee that may be a significant
            multiple of the amount we initially received. Accordingly, in
            order to enable you to pay relatively minor fees with a credit
            card, you acknowledge and agree that we reserve the right to
            suspend your ability to add additional Content to your Memiq
            game/app account until such time as you reimburse us the amount
            of the fee we were charged by the card issuer.

            <b>MODIFICATIONS OF THESE GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS.</b>
            <ol>
                <li>Spracter (and Spracter GameDivision) reserves the right to amend these General Terms and Conditions and other terms and conditions with effect for the future.</li>
                <li>Spracter (and Spracter GameDivision) shall notify you in writing (e.g. by message within the Game or by e-mail) at least four weeks in advance of any changes for necessary reasons, e.g. for reasons relating to the expansion of services or changes to the Games, amendments to laws or legal rulings or other equivalent reasons that do not affect the main performance duties of the parties. These General Terms and Conditions shall then be deemed approved if the user does not object in writing or in text form within four weeks of receiving this information. The time limit for objection and the consequences of silence shall be indicated separately in the notice.</li>
                <li>Changes other than those mentioned in the second point shall require the user’s consent, which can be requested at the start of the next Game.</li>
                <li>If there is an objection in accordance with the second point or no consent given in accordance with the third point, the user shall retain the right to use the current version of the Game. However, Spracter (and Spracter GameDivision) may make the use of an extended version of the Game subject to approval of the modification of these General Terms and Conditions.</li>
            </ol>
            <br />
            <br />
            <b>WARRANTY, LIABILITY.</b>
            <ol>
                <li>Insofar as Spracter (and Spracter GameDivision) provides services free of charge, no warranty claims shall exist and Spracter (and Spracter GameDivision) shall only be liable in accordance with the provisions of law for intentional and gross negligence; Spracter (and Spracter GameDivision) shall only be liable for defects if it has fraudulently concealed them.</li>
                <li>If services are rendered in return for payment, the warranty claims of the user shall be governed by the provisions of law, unless stipulated otherwise in this section.</li>
                <li>A warranty shall only be given for the current program version.</li>
                <li>The statutory liability of Spracter (and Spracter GameDivision) for damage compensation and reimbursement of futile expenses shall be unrestricted only in the event of intentional action or gross negligence, in the event of negligent or intentional injury to life, limb or health, due to the assumption of a guarantee (which must be expressly designated as such in order to constitute a guarantee in the legal sense), and due to mandatory liability under the Product Liability Act. “Material contractual duties” shall mean duties whose fulfilment initially enables the achievement of the contractual purpose and on whose compliance the parties may therefore normally rely.</li>
                <li>In events other than those referred to in the previous point, Spracter (and Spracter GameDivision) shall only be liable for minor negligence in the event of a breach of a material contractual duty. Otherwise, Spracter (and Spracter GameDivision) shall not be liable for minor negligence.</li>
                <li>The damage compensation for the minor negligent breach of material contractual duties in accordance with the previous point shall be limited to the foreseeable damage typical in contracts.</li>
                <li>To the extent Spracter (and Spracter GameDivision) is liable for data loss on the merits in accordance with the foregoing, the amount of such liability shall also be limited to the costs that would have been necessary to restore the data if the user had made reasonable regular data backups.</li>
            </ol>
